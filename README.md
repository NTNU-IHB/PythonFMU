### How do I build an FMU from python code?

1) Install `pythonfmu` package:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/NTNU-IHB/PythonFMU.git
```
2) Create a new class extending the `Fmi2Slave` class declared in the `pythonfmu.fmi2slave` module. 
3) Run `pythonfmu-builder` to create the fmu.

```
usage: pythonfmu-builder [-h] -f SCRIPT_FILE [-d DEST]
                         [--doc DOCUMENTATION_FOLDER]
                         [Project files [Project files ...]]

Build a FMU from a Python script.

positional arguments:
  Project files         Additional project files required by the Python
                        script.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f SCRIPT_FILE, --file SCRIPT_FILE
                        Path to the Python script.
  -d DEST, --dest DEST  Where to save the FMU.
  --doc DOCUMENTATION_FOLDER
                        Documentation folder to include in the FMU.
```

##### Example: 

###### Write the script

```python

from pythonfmu import Fmi2Causality, Fmi2Slave, Boolean, Integer, Real, String

slave_class = "PythonSlave"  # REQUIRED - Name of the class extending Fmi2Slave


class PythonSlave(Fmi2Slave):

    author = "John Doe"
    description = "A simple description"

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        self.intOut = 1
        self.realOut = 3.0
        self.booleanVariable = True
        self.stringVariable = "Hello World!"
        self.register_variable(Integer("intOut", causality=Fmi2Causality.output))
        self.register_variable(Real("realOut", causality=Fmi2Causality.output))
        self.register_variable(Boolean("booleanVariable", causality=Fmi2Causality.local))
        self.register_variable(String("stringVariable", causality=Fmi2Causality.local))

    def do_step(self, current_time, step_size):
        return True

```

###### Create the FMU 

```
pythonfmu-builder -f pythonslave.py pythonfmu
```

In this example a python class named `PythonSlave` that extends `Fmi2Slave` is declared in a file named `pythonslave.py`. 
`pythonfmu` is a optional folder containing additional project files required by the python script. 
Project folders such as this will be recursively copied into the FMU. Multiple project files/folders may be added.

### Note

PythonFMU does not bundle Python, which makes it a tool coupling solution. This means that you can not expect the generated FMU to work on a different system (The system would need a compatible Python version and libraries). But to ease its usage the wrapper is compile using
the limited Python API. So the provided binary libraries for Linux and Windows 64-bits should
be compatible of any Python 3 environment.
PythonFMU does not automatically resolve 3rd party dependencies either. If your code includes e.g. `numpy`, the target system also needs to have `numpy` installed.
